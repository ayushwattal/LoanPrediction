# LoanPredictionML

● Predict the Loan approval status based information - Gender, Credit history, Marital status, Number of dependents, loan amount, etc.

● Data exploration with multiple EDA tools and data transformation.

● Deliver the best model to predict whether the loan should be approved or not.

● Python code used for predictive analytics for various machine learning models.

● Model validation performed on various models.
 
This Project uses Loan Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/burak3ergun/loan-data-set?select=loan_data_set.csv

We have used 4 models in this project - Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Clasifier and Gradient Boosting.

In Modeling Phase we will create models, tune model using Hyper-Paramter Optimization , Validate using Stratefied K-Fold and then evaluate using metrics such as F1-Score, Accuracy Score, ROC and AUC etc.

 Logistic Regression was the best model among all the models.
